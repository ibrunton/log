NAME
    log - command-line log/journal processing

VERSION
    2.0

SYNOPSIS
     log [OPTIONS] [YYYY/MM/DD] [TIME] [TEXT]
     log 10/03 1201 lunch
     log -n :std_nap_string -c very refreshing

DESCRIPTION
    This program facillitates keeping flat-file journals via the command
    line.

  DATES
    If no date is passed, log will use the current date. To add to the log
    of a different date, past or future, you can pass the full date in the
    format YYYY/MM/DD; or only MM/DD and the current year will be used; or
    only DD and the current year and month will be used.

    You may also specify a date differential, which will be *subtracted*
    from the current date (or the date specified in the above format). This
    takes the format n*N*, where N is any integer (and n is a literal n).

    The date and date differential, if specified, must be the first
    arguments passed after input flags.

  TIME
    The time of the current entry is automatically generated by the script,
    unless cancelled by one of the input flags (-c, -i, -T ), or unless a
    different time is passed in the format HHMM. It is always 24-hour time.

    The -r flag rounds the time to the nearest five minutes.

    Time is ordinarily prepended to the line, followed by a colon and tab
    ("\t") character. You may optionally follow the time with a "~" or "?"
    to indicate approximate or uncertain timing.

    The -n flag appends the time to the end of the entry, rather than the
    beginning.

  SNIPPETS
    Commonly used entries, or parts of entries, may be reused. Place the
    frequently used text in a file in the snippet_dir (see Configuration
    options below, and type :snippet_name on the command line. The script
    will replace :snippet_name with the contents of the file with that name.

    Snippets are not recursive; snippet names within snippets will not be
    expanded. This functionality may be added to future versions.

  COMMENTS
    Comments may be added to the log file. To do so, either place the -c
    flag as the first argument, in which case the whole entry will be
    written as a comment, preceded by the comment delimiter (which can be
    specified in the rc file), or else you may place the comment delimiter
    itself, or -c, anywhere within the line of input, in which case all text
    from that point forward will be a comment, without a line break before
    it.

  REPLACING TEXT
    If you use snippets but occasionally wish to modify the text within them
    on a case-by-case basis, use the snippet as usual and then add a
    substitution macro to the input. This takes the form of
    -s/original/replacement/ or -s#original#replacement#. You may specify as
    many such macros within a line of input as you wish; each replacement
    will be performed as many times as possible on the input.

OPTIONS
    -a      Cancels the automatic appendage of a newline to the input
            passed.

    -c      Treats the whole line (or anything after -c, which may occur at
            any point in a line) as a comment. -c will be replaced with ;;.

    -e      Deprecated. Outputs the log file. For this functionality see the
            clog script included with this file.

    -h      Prints this help message.

    -i      Indents the line with a tab character.

    -j      Writes input to a file named YYYY/MM/DD.journal. Useful for
            longer diary-type entries. A notation is added to the main log
            file to indicate the presence of a journal entry.

    -n      Appends the current time to the end of the input line, rather
            than placing it at the beginning.

    -q      Suppresses automatic echoing of the current input line.

    -r      Rounds the time to the nearest 5 minutes.

    -R      Cancels previously set rounding.

    -s      Does something to do with state.

    -t      Indicates that this input line is for the training log, rather
            than the main log file. Input will be written to a file whose
            name ends in .training.

    -T      The current time will not be added to this line.

    -w      The current input line will not be wrapped. Useful for snippets
            which are pre-formatted.
